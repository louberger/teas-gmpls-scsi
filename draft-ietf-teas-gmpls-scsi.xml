        This document defines a generic information structure for
        information carried in routing protocol Interface Switching
        Capability Descriptor (ISCD) Switching Capability Specific
        Information (SCSI) fields.  This "Generalized SCSI" can be used
        with routing protocols that define GMPLS ISCDs, and any specific
        technology.  This document does not modify any existing
        technology specific formats and is defined for use in
        conjunction with new GMPLS Switching Capability types.
        The context for this document is Generalized MPLS, and the
        reader is expected to be familiar with the GMPLS architecture
        and associate protocol standards.

      <t>
        The context for this document is Generalized MPLS, and the
        reader is expected to be familiar with the GMPLS architecture,
        associate terminology and protocol standards. Notably, but
        not limited to, <xref target="RFC3945"/>, <xref
        target="RFC4202"/>, <xref target="RFC4203"/> and <xref
        target="RFC5307"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Interface Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD) <xref
        target="RFC4202"/> allows routing protocols such as OSPF and
        ISIS to carry technology specific information in the the
        Switching Capability-specific information (SCSI) field, see
        <xref target="RFC4203"/> and <xref target="RFC5307"/>.  The
        format of an SCSI field is dictated by the specific technology
        being represented as indicated by the ISCD Switching Capability
        (SC) type field.  Existing Switching Capabilities are managed by
        IANA in the <eref
        target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/gmpls-sig-parameters/gmpls-sig-parameters.xml#gmpls-sig-parameters-3">Switching
        Types registry</eref> and the related "IANA-GMPLS-TC-MIB"
        definitions.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC7138"/> introduced a "sub-TLV" structure to its
        technology specific SCSI field.  The Sub-Type-Length-Value (TLV)
        based approach allows for greater flexibility in the structure,
        ordering, and ability to support extensions of the SC
        (technology) specific format.  This Sub-TLV approach is also
        used in <xref target="RFC7688"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document generalizes this approach and defines a new
        generalized SCSI field format for use by future specific
        technologies and Switching Capability types.  The generalized
        SCSI carries SCSI-TLVs that may be defined within the scope of a
        specific technology, or shared across multiple technologies
        (e.g., <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-ospf-availability-extension"/>).  This
        document also establishes a registry for SCSI-TLV definitions
        that may be shared across multiple technologies.

        The reader is expected to be familiar with GMPLS terminology,
        e.g. as found in <xref target="RFC3945"/>, as well as the

    <section title="Generalized SCSI Formats" anchor="sec-format">
      <t>
        The Generalized SCSI is composed of zero or more variable length
        type-length-value fields which are each called a SCSI-TLV.
        There are no specific size restrictions on these SCSI-TLV.  Size
        and other formatting restrictions may be imposed by the routing
        protocol ISCD field, refer to <xref target="RFC4203"/> and <xref
        target="RFC5307"/>. Please also refer to <xref target="RFC3630"/> for
        the treatment of malformed Link TLVs.

      <t>
        The ISCD can include a Generalized SCSI when advertising technologies
        whose Switching Capability definition references this document.
        The corollary of this is that the Generalized SCSI MUST NOT be
        used for ISCDs of technologies whose Switching Capability
        definition do not reference this document.
      </t>      <t>
        The Generalized SCSI MAY contain a sequence of zero or more
        SCSI-TLVs.  Sub-TLV parsing (format) errors, such as an underrun
        or overrun, MUST be treated as a malformed ISCD.  SCSI-TLVs MUST
        be processed in the order received and, if re-originated,
        ordering MUST be preserved.  Unknown SCSI-TLVs MUST be ignored
        and transparently processed, i.e., re-originated when appropriate.
        Processing related to multiple SCSI-TLVs of the same type may be
        further refined based on the definition on the type.

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec-secu">
      <t>
        This document does not introduce any security issue beyond those
        discussed in <xref target="RFC4203"/> and <xref
        target="RFC5307"/>. As discussed there, the information carried
        in ISCDs are not used for SPF computation or normal routing and
        the extensions here defined do not have direct effect on IP
        routing. Tampering with GMPLS TE LSAs may have an effect on the
        underlying transport network.  Mechanisms such as <xref
        target="RFC2154"/> and <xref target="RFC5304"/> to protect the
        transmission of this information are suggested.

        This document defines a new SCSI-TLV that is carried in the SCSI
        field of the ISCDs defined in <xref target="RFC4203"/> and <xref
        target="RFC5307"/>.  The SCSI-TLV includes a 16-bit type
        identifier (the Type field).  The same Type field values are
        applicable to the new SCSI-TLV.

      <t>
        IANA is requested to create and maintain a new registry, the
        "Generalized SCSI (Switching Capability Specific Information)

        Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters"
        registry.
